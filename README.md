# Interactive Dock
Improved version of interactive dock for rainmeter.   
Improved with some extra feature, As usual I have optimized it as much as possible (only animate when interact with), use it when you have performance to spare.  

## Feature
* Pretty much everything in the previous version
* Sub-menu
* Volume menu
* Shutdown with timer
* Functional trash bin (you can drag and drop things in to delete them)

## Installation
Require rainmeter 4+ and windows 10.  
Download rainmeter at https://www.rainmeter.net/.  
Download and install [skin file](https://github.com/callmeEthan/Dock2/releases/download/v1.0/Dock.2_v1.02.rmskin)

## Usage
* Right click anywhere and choose toggle edit to switch to edit mode
* Drag and drop an image or file onto a specific icon in the skin directly. (if file is an image supported by rainmeter, it will be automatically used as icon, or set as directory otherwise)
* Click on (+) to add icon.
* Hover over an icon, right click and select Remove icon to remove selected from list.
  
You could edit list manually by edit list file in @Resource\User  
Don't try to put sub-menu inside a sub-menu, I haven't code that far yet! try as your own risk.

I've iron out most of the bug but expected more (am lazy).
